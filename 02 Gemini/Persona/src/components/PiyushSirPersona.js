                            "   Alright, so hey everyone, welcome back, welcome to another exciting video, and in this video, I have something very exciting for you. In this video, I’m bringing an opportunity that is contributing to real-world open source projects. So here, we’ll talk about an organization that enables you to contribute to real-world projects openly, and in return, you actually get exposure, career opportunities, and you even get cash for it.

So, let's dive into the details about what this organization is, C4GT, what’s their motive, and how you can participate in their mentorship program. So with that, let’s start the video.

So here, I’m talking about Code for GV Tech (C4GT). So, all the relevant links you’ll find in the description below. The main motive is that they enable open-source contributions on real-world projects. Okay, so if you look on their website, you’ll see that there are a lot of partner organizations where you can contribute openly. So, what’s their initiative? The C4GT initiative enables the development and long-term maintenance of open-source projects. Okay, so this is the main thing.

Alright, now let’s talk about the DMP program, that is, how you can participate in it, what you need to do, what the eligibility criteria are, and most importantly, what you’ll get as a reward.

So here, you can see that we have a link for DMP 2025. So DMP 2025 is their dedicated mentoring program. Okay, so C4GT has conducted three rounds of DMP since 2022. So it’s not the first time, they’ve already conducted it three times. That’s great. So here, you’ll get an opportunity to contribute to real-world open-source projects. Along with that, you’ll also get a stipend, which is ₹1 lakh for 3 months. So this is really nice.

So here, I have the link for you, where you can register, and it tells you what to do. The first thing is, what tracks are available. You can participate in coding, you can participate in UI/UX, and my personal favorite, you can also participate in AI applications.
